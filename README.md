## 🛡️ Safety, Security, and Ban Risk

Using any executor comes with **risks**:

- 🔐 **File Safety**  
  - Only download from official or well-known sources.
  - Avoid “cracked”, re-uploaded, or “modded” versions from unknown users.
  - Scan with reputable antivirus/anti-malware tools.

- 🚫 **Account Safety**  
  - Executing scripts breaks Roblox’s Terms of Service.
  - There is always a possibility of warnings or bans.
  - Use alternate accounts for testing scripts rather than your main account.

- 🧪 **Script Safety**  
  - Not every script is safe, even if the executor is.
  - Be careful with scripts that obfuscate everything or come from unknown paste sites.
  - Test new scripts in low-risk environments first.

## ❓ FAQ

### 1. Is Matcha Executor free?

Most public builds of Matcha Executor are free to use. Some may use a short key system, linkvertise, or similar gateway to support development. Always confirm that the version is from an official source before completing any steps.

### 2. Does Matcha work on every Roblox game?

No executor can guarantee 100% compatibility. Matcha supports a large variety of games (simulators, role-play, PvP, etc.), but some titles have stronger anti-cheat or custom protections. Incompatibility often comes from the script, not the executor itself.

### 3. Why is my antivirus deleting Matcha?

Executors inject code into another process (Roblox), which looks similar to how some malware behaves. Many antiviruses flag this behavior by default. If you trust the source, whitelist the folder—but always analyze the file first with trusted security tools.

### 4. Can Matcha Executor get my account banned?

Yes, any form of exploiting can lead to account actions. Roblox can detect certain patterns, especially blatant cheats. To lower risk:
- Avoid obvious cheating in competitive modes.
- Use alternate accounts.
- Keep an eye on community reports about recent ban waves.

### 5. Which platforms does Matcha support?

Matcha Executor is primarily designed for **Windows PC**. Some experimental setups claim mobile support through complex workarounds, but they are generally unstable and not officially supported. For best results, use a Windows desktop or laptop.

### 6. What should I do if Matcha crashes or fails to attach?

Try these steps:

- Close Roblox and Matcha completely.
- Reopen Matcha first, then Roblox, then attach.
- Disable conflicting overlays or injectors (e.g., some recording/overlay tools).
- Check for a new Matcha update after a major Roblox patch.

### 7. Where can I find scripts and help?

The community often shares scripts and assistance through:
- Forums and communities where users discuss executors.
- Social channels and script-sharing servers that focus on Roblox exploits.

Always practice caution with files and external links, even when recommended by other users.
